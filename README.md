# Overview 
This project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt and decrypt color images using Python. The aim is to secure image data and evaluate the performance and security of AES. The project explains how AES works, including key transformations and modes of operation. Different AES modes are tested, and their effectiveness is compared using tests such as histogram, correlation, and entropy analysis. The project also checks how well AES resists certain attacks, such as differential and known plaintext attacks. This work demonstrates the practical use of AES for securing images.

# Requirements

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
each mode is in a separate folder!
