I'm glad it works now! Let me explain why this solution was successful:

1. **Block-level Processing**: By working directly with bytes and processing each AES block (16 bytes) individually, we ensured proper ECB mode encryption. Each block is encrypted independently, which is the core characteristic of ECB mode.

2. **Proper Header Handling**: The solution properly handles BMP headers by skipping the first 54 bytes, ensuring we only encrypt the actual image data.

3. **Systematic Modification**: By modifying one byte per block across the entire image, we ensured that the changes would propagate through the encryption process in a way that properly tests the avalanche effect.

4. **Raw Data Analysis**: Calculating NPCR and UACI on the raw encrypted data rather than trying to interpret it as an image gave us more accurate results.

For reference, in AES-ECB mode, you should typically see:
- NPCR values around 99.60%
- UACI values around 33.46%

These values indicate that:
- NPCR: A single-bit change in the plaintext results in changes to about 99.60% of the ciphertext bits
- UACI: The average intensity difference between encrypted images is around 33.46%

Would you like to add any additional analysis metrics or make any other improvements to the implementation?
